  sub_heading_1: Automatic collection of information
  sub_1_txt: |
    Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no
    logs policy. We process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
    absolutely necessary to maintain the Website or Services. Information
    collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse
    and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This
    statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
    identify any particular user of the system.
  sub_heading_2: Collection of personal information
  sub_2_txt_1: |
    You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any
    information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable
    individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website's features, you
    will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your
    name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly
    provide to us when you fill any online forms on the Website.  When required,
    this information may include the following:
  sub_2_txt_2: Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
  sub_2_txt_3: Contact information such as email address, address, etc.

    You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then
    you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website's features.
    Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
    contact us.
  sub_heading_3: Storing personal information
  sub_3_txt: |
    We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to
    comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
    agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
    We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
    Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would
    identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal
    Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
    erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot
    be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

    we collect is directly from you via our Website. However, we may also

    information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

    Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our
    Website, where you are located in the world and if one of the following
    applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes.
    This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
    Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of
    information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or
    for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary
    for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv)

  sub_4_txt_5: |
    Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information
    until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely
    on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we
    will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information
    is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
    enter into a contract.

  sub_5_txt: |
    You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us.
    In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the

    processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal

    you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it
    to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
    circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which

    the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right
    to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine
    readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to
    another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
    provided that your information is processed by automated means and that
    the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part
    of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

    not track its visitors over time and across third party websites. However,
    some third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they
    serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

    controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the

    disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no
    data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
    Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
    acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
    Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and
    privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and our

    appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and
    reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
    authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts

    of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
    required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website, send you
    an email.
